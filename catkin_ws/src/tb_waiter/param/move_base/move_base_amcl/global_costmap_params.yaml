global_costmap:
   global_frame: /map                   # Defines what coordinate frame the costmap should run in
   robot_base_frame: base_footprint     # defines the coordinate frame the costmap should reference for the base of the robot.
   update_frequency: 1.0                # determines the frequency, in Hz, at which the costmap will run its update loop.
   publish_frequency: 0.5               # parameter determines the rate, in Hz, at which the costmap will publish visualization information.
   map_topic: /map
   static_map: true                     # determines whether or not the costmap should initialize itself based on a map served by the map_server.
   transform_tolerance: 0.5             # Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. 
                                        # Serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system.

# If you aren't using an existing map or map server, set the static_map parameter to false.
