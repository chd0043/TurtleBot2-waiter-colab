local_costmap:
   global_frame: /map                   # Defines what coordinate frame the costmap should run in
   robot_base_frame: base_footprint     # defines the coordinate frame the costmap should reference for the base of the robot.
   update_frequency: 5.0                # determines the frequency, in Hz, at which the costmap will run its update loop.
   publish_frequency: 2.0               # parameter determines the rate, in Hz, at which the costmap will publish visualization information.
   static_map: false                    # determines whether or not the costmap should initialize itself based on a map served by the map_server.
   rolling_window: true                 # "true" means that the costmap will remain centered around the robot as the robot moves through the world
   width: 4.0                           # width of the costmap (meters)
   height: 4.0                          # height of the costmap (meters)
   resolution: 0.05                     # resolution of the costmap (meters/cell)
   transform_tolerance: 0.5             # Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. 
                                        # Serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system.

# The "global_frame", "robot_base_frame", "update_frequency", and "static_map" parameters are the same as described in the Global Configuration section above. 
# Note that its fine for the resolution of this grid to be different than the resolution of your static map, but most of the time we tend to set them equally.
